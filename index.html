      Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [m…õ ÅÀåtseÀêd…ôs Ààb…õnts, -d…õs -]
      ‚ìò),[6][7] commonly referred to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a
      German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926.
      Mercedes-Benz AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established in 2019) is
      headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz
      AG produces consumer luxury vehicles and light commercial vehicles badged
      as Mercedes-Benz. From November 2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy
      commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) are managed by Daimler Truck, a
      former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company
      in late 2021. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium
      vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.[8]<br>
      <br>
      The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes
      and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as
      the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile. The
      slogan for the brand is "the Best or Nothing".[9]
